# Rice-seedling-and-weed-detection
Unet segmention technique is used to recognise seperatly rice  seedling and weed.
<h2> Problem</h2>
Weed cause huge impact on production of the crop in agriculture.
For similar looking weed, recognizing and segmating itfrom crops are very difficult.
We used Unet model for overcomes from this problem.

<h2> Dataset</h2>
The dataset used in experiment is aquired from figshare. Dataset contain image with their ground truth image.
